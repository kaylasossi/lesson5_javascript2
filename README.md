### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. A concept I learned in this lesson is the if/else statements. Within the if/else statement, I had to write a calculation that multiplies each US dollar amount with each currency rate for each specific country. I created 14 cases for this. 
2. Another thing I learned in this assignment is how to parseFloat in order to set a number with 2 decimal places. Within the toFixed part you can enter how many decimal places you want your value to go to. This is very helpful when working with money amounts. 
3. The last lesson I learned was assigning each currency option a number value from 0 - 14. This way when completing the if/else statement, I was able to put each country's number value as the country.
